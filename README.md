Complete the open source emoji set _openmoji_ with more environmental emojis.

We've identified openmoji as the best chance to illustrate these crucial topics, but their ["climate-environment"](https://openmoji.org/library/#group=extras-openmoji%2Fclimate-environment) extra emoji list is quite incomplete and subjective at the moment.

I haven't read yet the process to submit new emojis to openmoji [(how to name them, etc.)](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), so this is a work repository meanwhile.

Keep in mind that these emojis won't make it to your messaging app, until unicode approves their need, and Apple, Google & co make their own version in their operating system.
